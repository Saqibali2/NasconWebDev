# ASAN WEB

## _Learning everything with fun and games_

**What is Asan Ilm?**
We are active as an open-source platform and provide a perfect place for everyone who is interested in education. Our main purpose is to combine gamification with learning to make it a unique experience for learners all over the world. Also, we prepare a valuable field for onboarding and its related features, which is a great opportunity for companies to take part.

## NB: our platform is under the development process and will be completed ASAP.*

# Why is the project useful?

Our business contains some aspects that are internationally popular. First, we have an open-source education platform that is widespread globally. Next is our multilingual feature that makes it available for all people to join our platform easily and make use of it as they wish. After that, in order to make our business more expandable everywhere and for everyone, we have planned to add a subtitle option to our videos, which is even more welcoming to those who are not fully dominant in the English language and makes it more user-friendly for our clients.

Gamification is considered another feature, which makes learning fun and pleasurable through various memorable items. Even the elimination of traditional exams will double this expenditure for our learners. As a result, our platform is applicable for all mentors, individuals, organizations, companies, and similar groups of people to make them aware of a specific learning procedure. We believe to be the top open-source eLearning platform that possesses many prospects since we are competing worldwide, and we must be unique and unrepeatable.

**How can users get started with the project?**

Our project is based on the Laravel framework, which partly supports the Livewire framework and uses the MYSQL Database Service. Since we are developing our platform and it takes time for us to complete, it is available for you to access our website AsanIlm.com to get the latest updates and features.
